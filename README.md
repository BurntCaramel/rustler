# Ruster (unsafe)

A crate for creating Erlang NIF modules in Rust.  This crate exposes the raw C NIF API which can be used directly or as a foundation for higher layer interface crates.

## Requirements

- Rust-1.0.0 or newer.
- Erlang-17.4 or newer.


## Example

## Notes and Limitations

- The NIF API is generated by an escript that probes the installed Erlang version and configuration.  "erl_nif.h" and the C compiler are not used (although they are used for tests).
- Tested on Linux, but any unix should be fine.
- Windows support is planned but not currently implemented.
- The NIF threading API is not implemented since Rust provides its own excellent, portable threading API.  But this could be implemented if there is a need.
- Varargs NIF functions are not implemented.
- ruster_unsafe is based on work by Rados≈Çaw Szymczyszyn (https://github.com/lavrin/erlang-rust-nif)
